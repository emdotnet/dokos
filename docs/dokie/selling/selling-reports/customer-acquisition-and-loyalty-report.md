# Customer Acquisition and Loyalty Report

To understand revenue, it often is helpful to look at the data from a new customer and existing customers standpoint. This report helps visualize customer loyalty.  There are two windows within this report: The Filter Window and the Data Window.

Accessing the Filter Window, the company and date ranges can be applied.  Data is updated in the Data Window as changes are applied.
  
Within the Data Window, columns of information are accessible. The label at the top of each column can be selected by hovering over the column heading and clicking. This will sort the data by this column in  an ascending or descending fashion. As well, the open data entry field immediately below the column can be used to further refine by filtering the data.  The following example demonstrates data that has been sorted in ascending order by total (orange) and has been filtered for the year 2018 (blue).
