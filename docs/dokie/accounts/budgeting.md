# Budgeting

In Dokie, you can set and manage budgets against a cost center or a project. This is useful in controlling your expenses.

For example, if you are doing online sales, you can set a budget for search ads, and configure Dokie to stop or warn you from over spending beyond the budget set.

Budgets are also great for planning purposes. When you are making plans for the next financial year, you would typically target a revenue based on which you would set your expenses. Setting a budget will ensure that your expenses do not get out of hand, at any point.

### Cost Center

> Accounts > Budget and Cost Center > Chart of Cost Center > Add New Cost Center

#### Step 4: Monthly Distribution

If you have seasonal business, you can also define a Monthly Distribution record, to distribute the budget between months. If you don't set the monthly distribution, Dokie will calculate the budget on yearly
basis or in equal proportion for every month.

#### Step 5: Control Actions(Alerts)

Control actions can be triggered while material request is being submitted, purchase order is being submitted or while actual expense is being posted(through a journal entry or a purchase invoice).  

There are three types of control actions.

* Stop: This will not allow users to submit the transaction.

* Warn: This will show a warning message but lets the user to submit the transaction.

* Ignore: This will neither prevent the user from submitting transaction nor show an error message.

You can set separate action for monthly and annual budgets.
