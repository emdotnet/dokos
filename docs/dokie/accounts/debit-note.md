## Debit Note

A debit note is a document sent by a buyer to a seller, or in other words, a purchaser to a vendor while returning goods received on credit. This notifies that a debit has been made to their accounts.

A debit note is issued for the value of the goods returned. In some cases, sellers are seen sending debit notes which should be treated as just another invoice.
