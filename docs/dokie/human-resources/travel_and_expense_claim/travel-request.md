#Travel Request
Employees can request funds for official travel using Travel Request. To create a new Travel Request, go to

> Human Resource > Travel and Expense Claim > Travel Request > New Travel Request

You can also mention the Travel Itinerary as well as the costs involved for the trip. Employees can also check `Travel Advance Required` if they wish to receive any upfront payment form the company.
