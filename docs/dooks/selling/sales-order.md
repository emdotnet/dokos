# Sales Order

The Sales Order confirms the receipt of an order from your customer. It is usually a binding Contract with your Customer. Once your customer confirms the Quotation you can convert your Quotation into
a Sales Order.

There are various transactions which can be triggered from Sales Order like;

* Delivery Note
* Sales Invoice
* Material Request
* Production Order
* Project

### Creating Sales Order from Quotation

You can also create a Sales Order from a submitted Quotation.

Or you can create a new Sales Order and pull details from an Quotation.

Most of the information in your Sales Order is the same as the Quotation.

There are a few amongst other things that a Sales Order will ask you to
update.

  * Enter Delivery Date agaist each item. If there are multiple items and if you enter delivery date in the first row, the date will be copied to other rows as well where it is blank.
  * Customer Purchase Order number: If your customer has sent you a Purchase Order, you can update its number for future reference (in billing).
  * To allow for per-Customer, per-Item Pricing Rules ("Customer A" pays $1.00 for "Item 1" but "Customer B" pays $1.25 for "Item 1"), there's a check box in Selling Settings to enable saving the specific item price per customer when you change a price in the Sales Order.

### Packing List

The “Packing List” table will be automatically updated when you “Save” the Sales Order. If any Items in your table are Product Bundle (packets), then the “Packing List” will contain the exploded (detailed) list of your Items.

### Reservation and Warehouses

If your Sales Order contains Items for which inventory is tracked (Is Stock Item is “Yes”) then, Dokie will ask you for “Reservation Warehouse”. If you have set a default Warehouse for the Item, it will automatically set this Warehouse here.

This “reserved” quantity will help you project what is the quantity you need to purchase based on all your commitments.

### Taxes

To add taxes to your Quotation, you can select a **Sales Taxes and Charges Template** or add the taxes on your own.

For e.g
