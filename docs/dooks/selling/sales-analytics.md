### Data Analytics and Charts

Within the data window, selections can be made to expand or compress the data to be analyzed.  At the left of the window, (blue), are selection boxes. Each box can be selected for use. There is no restriction for the data comparison, so a higher level can be compared to lower levels.  The data column to the right, (orange), contains selection boxes with + and minus selections. Selecting a + will expand the data and selecting a â€“ will compress the data. As this is performed, the Graph Window is dynamically altered allowing rapid data analysis.
