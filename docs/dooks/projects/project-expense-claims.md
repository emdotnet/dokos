# Project and Managing Expenses

The Employees working on the Project incur various expenses, sometimes from their own pocket. In Dokie, then can claim such expenses using [Expense Claim](/dokie/human-resources/travel_and_expense_claim/expense-claim.md)

In this Expense Claim, they can also select a Project for which that expense was incurred.

Based on the Expense Claims made for a particular project, total Expense Claim Amount is updated in the Project master, under project costing section.

* You can create an Expense Claims directly and link it to the Project.
