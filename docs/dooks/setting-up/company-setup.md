# Company

A company is a legal entity made up of an association of people for carrying on a commercial or industrial enterprise.

In Dooks, first Company is created on completion of account creation. For each Company, you can set a domain as manufacturing, retail, or services depending on the nature of your business activity.

If you have more than one company, you can add them from:

### Company Tree Structure

The company is a tree-structured master. It allows you to define a federated and group company structure.

Once you build a company tree, Dooks will validate that the accounts of the child companies will match the accounts in the parent company, so that you can consolidate all the accounts in a consolidated chart of accounts statement.

### Chart of Accounts

On each Company, the master for Chart of Account is maintained separately. This allows you to maintain separate accounting for each company as per the legal requirements.
