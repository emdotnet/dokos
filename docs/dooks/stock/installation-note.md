# Installation Note

An Installation Note can be created when a product/item is being installed or set up at the customer's place. 
If you, for example, sell a Washing Machine, a service person generally acompanies the delivery to install 
the machine at the customer’s place. The service person can create an “Installation Note”, to track the date 
and details of the installation.
