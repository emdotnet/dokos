 The Amazon Connector pulls Products and Sales Orders from Amazon marketplace.
 The sync of Products and Sales Orders is sequential. You have to sync the products before you Sync the Sales Orders.

 3. Setup Sync Configurations.
   Using the After Date, you can sync products and orders created after a particular date. In case you are importing a lot of historic data, it is suggested to start in the reverse chronological order of the After Date and import data in small chunks.
