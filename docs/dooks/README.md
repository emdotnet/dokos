## What is an ERP system? And why should anyone care to use it?

*If you are already convinced you need an all-in-one system for your
organization, you can skip this page.*

Today, small & medium sized businesses (SMEs) are not so different from large/enterprises. The SMEs face similar complexities as a large businesses do, but have limited resources to deal with such complexity. 

Small businesses (like their bigger counterparts) have to:

- do accounts to keep track of sales/ purchases
- pay taxes to the goverment
- pay their employees
- manage deliveries within promised timelines
- deliver quality goods and services
- communicate with customers, answer queries
And generally try to keep everyone happy.

Large enterprises have been able to invest 100s of millions of dollars in very sophisticated systems such as SAP. Systems like SAP are able to handle requirements from such large enterprises to bring their **multi country**, **multi company**, **multi currency**, global businesses into a single platform. This has helped them achieve consolidation of data / records related to basic process such as accounting, taxation, payroll, reporting and supply chain to name a few.  

In contrast to large enterprises, SMEs have been left out of the **1st wave of digital revolution (1995-2015)**. The main reason for being left out is because they dont  have the $ power to **license, hire programmers and customize** such software to match their needs. Systems like SAP have been **no-go** for most SMEs. Such systems need a **minimum** CAPEX or OPEX layout of **$100k (Yes, One Hundred Thousand Dollars)** and upwards. Even with cloud offerings (Software as a Service, SAAS) from such vendors, there is no easy Do It Yourself (DIY) people can feel confident about.  

So even today, small businesses continue to struggle to keep things organized. They often use a mix of applications and tools such as spreadsheets, accounting softwares, web based CRMs to manage their day to day record keeping. As a consequence, they have to access different systems to understand customers master data, sales, cash flows or profitability. The information exists in silos. The data is hard to combine to get useful insights or alerts. As a consequence, SMEs are **reactive** instead of being **proactive** in their day to day operations. With such a constrained way of working, there is limited scope for **growth**.
