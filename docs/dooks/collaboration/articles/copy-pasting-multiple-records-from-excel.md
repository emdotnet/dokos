3. Place the cursor to the target input field of the child table, paste it by Ctrl + V. Uunlike the import via upload file feature which also can batch input the child table, this copy & paste feature will trigger field change event automatically. In other word if only item_code is pasted, the item price, qty and other item code related fields will be auto populated just like user manually input item code and press ENTER. on the other hand, for performance consideration, less than 100 records per paste is allowed.
