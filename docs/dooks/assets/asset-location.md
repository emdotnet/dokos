# Asset Location

The assets that your organisation owns will be located at various facilities like administrative offices, manufacturing plants, warehouses etc. In Dooks you can create a 'Location' for each of your facilities and track the assets which are present in these locations.

You can also add Latitude and Longitude of the location.

When an asset is moved from one location to another you need to create an asset movement record.
