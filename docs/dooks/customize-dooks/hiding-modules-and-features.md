Click [here](/dooks/customize-dooks/articles/module-visibility.md) to learn about other features from where icons from the desktop can be hidden.

> Note: Modules are automatically hidden for users that have no permissions on the documents within that module. For example, if a User has no permissions on Purchase Order, Purchase Request, Supplier, the “Buying” module will automatically hidden for that User.
