If you are in services, you can create an Item for each service that you offer. If you run a manufacturing business, the same master is used for keeping a record of raw materials, sub-assemblies etc.\n\nCompleting the Item Master is very essential for the successful implementation of ERPNext. We have a brief video introducing the item master for you, you can watch it in the next step.",
