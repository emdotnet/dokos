 "description": "## Creating Products\n\nIn ERPNext, any product or a service offered by your company is called an Item. The term Item is also applicable to raw materials or components of products yet to be produced (before they can be sold to customers). ERPNext allows you to manage all sorts of items like raw-materials, sub-assemblies, finished goods, item variants, and service items.\n\nERPNext is optimized for itemized management of your sales and purchase. If you are in services, you can create an Item for each service that you offer. Completing the Item Master is very essential for the successful implementation of ERPNext.\n\nYou can access the Item section\n\n`Desk > Stock > Item`\n\n\n",
